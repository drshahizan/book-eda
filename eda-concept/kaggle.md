# What is EDA?

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.&#x20;

✅️ EDA involves using graphics and visualizations to explore and analyze a data set. The goal is to explore, investigate and learn, as opposed to confirming statistical hypotheses.

✅️ EDA is used by data scientists to analyze and explore datasets and summarize the main characteristics of them.

✅️ EDA makes it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

✅️ EDA is primarily used to provide a better understanding of dataset's variables and their relationships.

✅️ EDA can also help determine whether the statistical techniques you are considering are appropriate for data analysis.

✅️ Developed by the American mathematician John Tukey in the 1970s, EDA techniques continue to be a widely used method in the data exploration process today.

# Types of EDA

There are four primary types of exploratory data analysis (EDA):

## **1. Univariate non-graphical**

* Univariate non-graphical analysis is the simplest form of data analysis that focuses on a single variable.
* The main objective is to describe the data and identify patterns within it.
* This type of analysis does not consider causes or relationships between variables.

## **2. Univariate graphical**

Univariate analysis is the simplest form of data analysis where the data being analyzed contains only one variable. Since it’s a single variable it doesn’t deal with causes or relationships. The main purpose of univariate analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that exist within it.\
\
You can think of the variable as a category that your data falls into. One example of a variable in univariate analysis might be “age”. Another might be “height”. Univariate analysis would not look at these two variables at the same time, nor would it look at the relationship between them.

Some ways you can describe patterns found in univariate data include looking at mean, mode, median, range, variance, maximum, minimum, quartiles, and standard deviation. Additionally, some ways you may display univariate data include frequency distribution tables, bar charts, histograms, frequency polygons, and pie charts.

* Univariate graphical analysis involves using visual methods to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data.
* Common techniques used in this type of analysis include:
  * **Stem-and-leaf plots**: These plots show all data values and the distribution's shape.
  * **Histograms**: They provide a bar plot representation of the frequency or proportion of cases for different value ranges.
  * **Box plots**: These graphs display the five-number summary, including the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values.

## **3. Multivariate non-graphical**

* Multivariate non-graphical analysis deals with data that involves multiple variables.
* It focuses on exploring the relationships between two or more variables through cross-tabulation or statistical techniques.

## **4. Multivariate graphical**

Multivariate analysis is the analysis of three or more variables. There are many ways to perform multivariate analysis depending on your goals. Some of these methods include Additive Tree, Canonical Correlation Analysis, Cluster Analysis, Correspondence Analysis / Multiple Correspondence Analysis, Factor Analysis, Generalized Procrustean Analysis, MANOVA, Multidimensional Scaling, Multiple Regression Analysis, Partial Least Square Regression, Principal Component Analysis / Regression / PARAFAC, and Redundancy Analysis.

* Multivariate graphical analysis uses visualizations to explore relationships between multiple sets of data.
* Common techniques in this type of analysis include:
  * **Scatter plots**: These plots show the relationship between two variables by plotting data points on a horizontal and vertical axis.
  * **Multivariate charts**: They represent relationships between factors and a response variable graphically.
  * **Run charts**: These line graphs display data plotted over time, providing insights into trends and patterns.
  * **Bubble charts**: This visualization displays multiple circles (bubbles) on a two-dimensional plot, representing different data points.
  * **Heat maps**: Heat maps present data using color to represent values, providing a visual depiction of patterns or variations.

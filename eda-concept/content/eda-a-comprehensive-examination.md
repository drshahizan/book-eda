# EDA: A Comprehensive Examination

In the field of data analysis, the following aspects are investigated to derive meaningful insights:

1. Dataset's Shape and Overview: The initial step involves examining the structure of the dataset, including its dimensions and composition. This provides a foundational understanding of the dataset's shape and overall characteristics.
2. Missing Values: Identifying missing values is crucial for ensuring data quality. An analysis is performed to detect any missing values within the dataset and determine the extent of their presence. This enables informed decision-making regarding appropriate handling strategies for missing data.
3. Numerical Variables: Emphasis is placed on exploring the characteristics of numerical variables present in the dataset. Statistical measures, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, are computed to gain insights into central tendency, dispersion, and variability of these variables.
4. Distribution of Numerical Variables: Understanding the distribution of numerical variables is essential for accurate data interpretation. Visualizations and statistical techniques are employed to examine the shape, skewness, and kurtosis of these variables.
5. Outliers: Outliers, which significantly deviate from the majority of observations, are examined within the numerical variables. Their detection and investigation enable assessment of their impact on the analysis. Depending on the dataset's nature, appropriate actions such as exclusion, transformation, or handling are determined.
6. Categorical Variables: Analysis of categorical variables is conducted to gain insights into their composition and distribution. This involves exploring the various categories and their corresponding frequencies.
7. Cardinality of Categorical Variables: The cardinality, or the number of unique values, within categorical variables is assessed. This evaluation provides an understanding of the level of diversity within each variable, aiding in decisions related to variable transformation or feature engineering, if deemed necessary.
8. Relationship Between Independent and Dependent Features: The relationship between independent features and the dependent feature of interest is examined. Distributions of the independent features are plotted and analyzed to uncover potential patterns, correlations, or dependencies within the data.

By conducting these comprehensive analyses, meaningful insights can be derived, leading to informed decision-making throughout the data analysis process.

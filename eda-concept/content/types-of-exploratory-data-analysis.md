# Types of exploratory data analysis

There are four primary types of exploratory data analysis (EDA):

1. **Univariate non-graphical**:
   * Univariate non-graphical analysis is the simplest form of data analysis that focuses on a single variable.
   * The main objective is to describe the data and identify patterns within it.
   * This type of analysis does not consider causes or relationships between variables.
2. **Univariate graphical**:
   * Univariate graphical analysis involves using visual methods to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data.
   * Common techniques used in this type of analysis include:
     * **Stem-and-leaf plots**: These plots show all data values and the distribution's shape.
     * **Histograms**: They provide a bar plot representation of the frequency or proportion of cases for different value ranges.
     * **Box plots**: These graphs display the five-number summary, including the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values.
3. **Multivariate non-graphical**:
   * Multivariate non-graphical analysis deals with data that involves multiple variables.
   * It focuses on exploring the relationships between two or more variables through cross-tabulation or statistical techniques.
4. **Multivariate graphical**:
   * Multivariate graphical analysis uses visualizations to explore relationships between multiple sets of data.
   * Common techniques in this type of analysis include:
     * **Scatter plots**: These plots show the relationship between two variables by plotting data points on a horizontal and vertical axis.
     * **Multivariate charts**: They represent relationships between factors and a response variable graphically.
     * **Run charts**: These line graphs display data plotted over time, providing insights into trends and patterns.
     * **Bubble charts**: This visualization displays multiple circles (bubbles) on a two-dimensional plot, representing different data points.
     * **Heat maps**: Heat maps present data using color to represent values, providing a visual depiction of patterns or variations.

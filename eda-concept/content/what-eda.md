# What is EDA?

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.

✅️ EDA involves using graphics and visualizations to explore and analyze a data set. The goal is to explore, investigate and learn, as opposed to confirming statistical hypotheses.

✅️ EDA is used by data scientists to analyze and explore datasets and summarize the main characteristics of them.

✅️ EDA makes it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

✅️ EDA is primarily used to provide a better understanding of dataset's variables and their relationships.

✅️ EDA can also help determine whether the statistical techniques you are considering are appropriate for data analysis.

✅️ Developed by the American mathematician John Tukey in the 1970s, EDA techniques continue to be a widely used method in the data exploration process today.

There are various tools available for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) that aid in visualizing and analyzing data sets. One widely used tool is the **Python** programming language, which offers libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, providing powerful functionalities for data manipulation, numerical computing, and visualization. **R**, another popular programming language for statistical analysis, provides packages like **ggplot2** and **dplyr** that are specifically designed for EDA tasks. Data visualization platforms like **Tableau** and **Power BI** offer intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces for creating interactive visualizations. Additionally, **Jupyter Notebook** and its variants, such as **JupyterLab** and **Google Colab**, provide an interactive environment combining code, visualizations, and narrative elements, making them ideal for conducting EDA and sharing analysis workflows. These tools empower data scientists and analysts to effectively explore and communicate insights from the data.

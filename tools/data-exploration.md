# Data Exploration

Data exploration is the initial act of getting to know your data and what you’re working with, often working with raw data to find any initial characteristics and patterns. Data visualization can help here by visualizing your datasets. It’s also part of the initial process of preparing your data, and may involve cleaning, transforming, and working with any anomalies. These tools will help make your initial data exploration process easy.

The primary goal of ydata-profiling is to provide a one-line Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) experience in a consistent and fast solution. ydata-profiling delivers an extended analysis of a DataFrame while allowing the data analysis to be exported in different formats such as HTML and JSON.

Sweetviz is an open-source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with just two lines of code. Output is a fully self-contained HTML application. The system is built around quickly visualizing target values and comparing datasets. Its goal is to help with a quick analysis of target characteristics, training vs testing data, and other such data characterization tasks.

Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive online platform that visualizes algorithms from code. It offers visualization tools in various languages including JavaScript, Java, and C++. The project was inspired by a group of coders looking to visualize what they’re working on, thus creating a tool that can show algorithms and descriptions of algorithms in real time.

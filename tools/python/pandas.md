## What is it?

**pandas** is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on its way towards this goal.

## Main Features

Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:

* Easy handling of [**missing data**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/missing\_data.html) (represented as `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data
* Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and deleted**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion) from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects
* Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/dsintro.html?highlight=alignment#intro-to-data-structures): objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations
* Powerful, flexible [**group by**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine) functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data
* Make it [**easy to convert**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe) ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects
* Intelligent label-based [**slicing**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/indexing.html#slicing-ranges), [**fancy indexing**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/advanced.html#advanced), and [**subsetting**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing) of large data sets
* Intuitive [**merging**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging) and [**joining**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/merging.html#joining-on-index) data sets
* Flexible [**reshaping**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/reshaping.html) and [**pivoting**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/reshaping.html) of data sets
* [**Hierarchical**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex) labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)
* Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/io.html#csv-text-files) (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/io.html#excel-files), [**databases**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/io.html#sql-queries), and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/io.html#hdf5-pytables)
* [**Time series**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user\_guide/timeseries.html#time-series-date-functionality)-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging

## Where to get it

The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas

Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

```sh
# conda
conda install -c conda-forge pandas
```

```sh
# or PyPI
pip install pandas
```

The list of changes to pandas between each release can be found [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/index.html). For full details, see the commit logs at https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas.

## Dependencies

* [NumPy - Adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays, matrices and high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays](https://www.numpy.org)
* [python-dateutil - Provides powerful extensions to the standard datetime module](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
* [pytz - Brings the Olson tz database into Python which allows accurate and cross platform timezone calculations](https://github.com/stub42/pytz)

See the [full installation instructions](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#dependencies) for minimum supported versions of required, recommended and optional dependencies.

## Installation from sources

To install pandas from source you need [Cython](https://cython.org/) in addition to the normal dependencies above. Cython can be installed from PyPI:

```sh
pip install cython
```

In the `pandas` directory (same one where you found this file after cloning the git repo), execute:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

or for installing in [development mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/cli/pip\_install/#install-editable):

```sh
python -m pip install -e . --no-build-isolation --no-use-pep517
```

or alternatively

```sh
python setup.py develop
```

See the full instructions for [installing from source](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting\_started/install.html#installing-from-source).

## Documentation

The official documentation is hosted on [PyData.org](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/).

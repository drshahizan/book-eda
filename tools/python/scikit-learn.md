**scikit-learn** is a Python module for machine learning built on top of
SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer
of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
the `About us <https://scikit-learn.org/dev/about.html#authors>`__ page
for a list of core contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.

## Installation

Dependencies

scikit-learn requires:

- Python (>= |PythonMinVersion|)
- NumPy (>= |NumPyMinVersion|)
- SciPy (>= |SciPyMinVersion|)
- joblib (>= |JoblibMinVersion|)
- threadpoolctl (>= |ThreadpoolctlMinVersion|)

**Scikit-learn 0.20 was the last version to support Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.**
scikit-learn 1.0 and later require Python 3.7 or newer.
scikit-learn 1.1 and later require Python 3.8 or newer.

Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions start with ``plot_`` and
classes end with "Display") require Matplotlib (>= |MatplotlibMinVersion|).
For running the examples Matplotlib >= |MatplotlibMinVersion| is required.
A few examples require scikit-image >= |Scikit-ImageMinVersion|, a few examples
require pandas >= |PandasMinVersion|, some examples require seaborn >=
|SeabornMinVersion| and plotly >= |PlotlyMinVersion|.

## User installation

If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,
the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using `pip`

    pip install -U scikit-learn

or `conda`

    conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn

The documentation includes more detailed `installation instructions <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html>`_.

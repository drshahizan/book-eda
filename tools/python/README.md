# üêç Python Libraries

An interpreted, object-oriented programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level, built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for rapid application development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python and EDA can be used together to identify missing values in a data set, which is important so you can decide how to handle missing values for machine learning.

Python is a popular programming language for data science and has several libraries and tools that are commonly used for EDA such as:

1. **[Pandas](pandas.md)**: a library for data manipulation and analysis.
2. **[Numpy](numpy.md)**: a library for numerical computing in Python.
3. **[Matplotlib](matplotlib.md)**: a plotting library for creating visualizations.
4. **[Seaborn](seaborn.md)**: a library based on matplotlib for creating visualizations with a higher-level interface.
5. **[Plotly](plotly.md)**: an interactive data visualization library.

In EDA, you might perform tasks such as cleaning the data, handling missing values, transforming variables, generating summary statistics, creating visualizations (e.g. histograms, scatter plots, box plots), and identifying outliers. All of these tasks can be done using the above libraries in Python.

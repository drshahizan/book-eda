# Â® R

R is an **open source** programming language thatâ€™s optimized for **statistical analysis** and **data visualization**. Developed in 1992, R has a rich ecosystem with complex data models and elegant tools for **data reporting**. At last count, more than **13,000 R packages** were available via the **Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)** for **deep analytics**.

Popular among **data science scholars** and **researchers**, R provides a broad variety of libraries and tools for the following:

* **Cleansing** and **prepping data**
* **Creating visualizations**
* **Training** and **evaluating machine learning** and **deep learning algorithms**

R is commonly used within **RStudio**, an **integrated development environment (IDE)** for simplified statistical analysis, visualization, and reporting. R applications can be used directly and interactively on the web via **Shiny**. R beginners can also use these libraries as they are easy to use and can help them quickly understand the dataset with a few code lines.

## Automated Exploratory Data Analysis packages

### DataExplorer

ðŸ”— [GitHub](https:/) | [Website](https:/)

This is one of the most commonly used AutoEDA packages in R. With DataExplorer, we can simplify the EDA process and report generation. This library automatically scans the dataset for variables, performs data profiling, and provides many useful functions to create various charts on both discrete and continuous features in the dataset.

Let us look at the code we need to install and use the DataExplorer library

```
# Installing the package
install.packages("DataExplorer")

# Importing the library
library(DataExplorer)
create_report(mtcars)
data()
```

The DataExplorer library generates a complete HTML report in the working directory for the EDA on the dataset using the create\_report function. This function also accepts additional arguments to customize the EDA report. The report HTML file, when opened with a browser, looks like the following â€“

From the above .gif image of the report, we can see that the table of contents indicates a comprehensive report covering most of the tasks performed during EDA generated with just one line of code. Here are some sample plots from the report at a glance-

### SmartEDA

ðŸ”— [GitHub](https:/) | [Website](https:/)

The next AutoEDA library is SmartEDA which is a powerful package for automating most EDA tasks through functions for Descriptive statistics, Data visualization, Custom tables, and HTML reports.

Similar to the previous DataExplorer package, the SmartEDA library also allows us to generate a complete HTML report using the ExpReport function. Let us install and import the package as well as run the ExpReport function to perform the EDA, as shown below.

```
# Install package
install.packages("SmartEDA")
# Import library
library(SmartEDA)
ExpReport(df,op_file='smartEDA.html')
```

This ExpReport function accepts several arguments to customize the report for Template, op\_file,op\_dir, label, theme, etc.

Here, we will use the â€˜op\_fileâ€™ function to name the report.html file. This report file is available with the specified name in the working directory and can be opened with a browser. The snippet of the .html report shown below provides information on how well the SmartEDA package has summarized the â€˜mtcarsâ€™ dataset.

Here are a few sample plots from the report â€“

From the .html report, we can see that it contains several plots generated with just one line of code and these plots are useful in understanding the dataset better. The documentation for SmartEDA can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SmartEDA/index.html).

### dataMaid

The dataMaid package creates a report in different formats, such as PDF, DOCX, or HTML. The generated report checks and neatly simply summarizes the dataset. It is a good tool for checking errors in the dataset.

To utilize the dataMaid package, one can execute the given command to install, import, and run it.

```
# Install package
install.packages("dataMaid")
# Import library
library(dataMaid)
# Create report
makeDataReport(df, output = "html", replace = TRUE)
```

<figure><img src="https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/85664datamaid.gif" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From the above .gif for the .html report generated by the dataMaid package, we can see that all the discrepancies in the dataset are summarized variable by variable in the generated report. Thus, it is easier to understand the data quality and decide on the next steps required for data cleaning.

The [dataMaid package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataMaid/index.html) can be explored for additional details.

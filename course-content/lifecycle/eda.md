# EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data analysis process, where analysts or data scientists examine and summarize the main characteristics and patterns of the data before proceeding with more formal statistical analyses or modeling. The EDA life cycle typically involves several steps, which can be summarized as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from various sources, ensuring data quality and integrity.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and rectify errors, missing values, and inconsistencies.
3. **Data Exploration**: Use summary statistics and basic data visualization techniques to understand data characteristics, distribution, central tendencies, spread, and outliers.
4. **Data Visualization**: Represent data visually using charts, graphs, and plots to gain insights and identify patterns.
5. **Data Transformation**: Transform data to make it suitable for analysis by scaling, normalization, encoding categorical variables, or creating new features.
6. **Hypothesis Generation**: Formulate hypotheses about relationships or patterns for further testing.
7. **Feature Selection**: Choose the most relevant features for analysis from a large dataset.
8. **Correlation Analysis**: Explore correlations between variables to understand their relationships and influences.
9. **Missing Data Handling**: Decide on imputation methods or discarding incomplete records to deal with missing values.
10. **Outlier Detection**: Identify and handle outliers, which can significantly impact analysis results.
11. **Pattern Recognition**: Discover patterns, trends, and interesting structures within the data using advanced analysis techniques.
12. **Interpretation and Conclusion**: Draw conclusions and make decisions based on insights gained from EDA for further data analysis or modeling.
